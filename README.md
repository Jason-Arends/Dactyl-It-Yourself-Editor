# Dactyl-It-Yourself-Editor

OpenSCAD implementation of Dactyl-like keyboard
no clojure because I'm allergic to java
Motivation: Rapid generation and prototyping of layouts and somewhat readable generators

1. Open Editor
2. modify Parameter in Layouts
3. a lot of other bullshits
4. Render top and bottom enclosure
5. Render Bottom Plate
6. Iterate to your hearts content.


Pseudoku's junkie Protos:
notation: (col x row + extra) + [ThumbCol0 ThumbCol1 ThumbCol2...]

Genus:Warp
hypowarp:   (6x3+2)+[121] choc dactyl clone with my take on thumb cluster.
miniwarp_A: (5x3+2)+[121] cut caps, but normal mx switch compaction with same TC as hypowarp
miniwarp_B: (5x3+2)+[022] with different thumb cluster to reduce size (also not no down thumb press)

Genus: Gigi
GiGi:        (6x2)+[021] the plover + dactyl = pterodactyl
GiGi_TB:     (6x2)+[021] with 34mm Trackball
Incredulous: (4x2+2)+[012] Pushing to the limit with 40mm Trackball

Genus:Flat
CorneTron:  (5x3)+[1111] potential switchception


planned:
miniwarp_C: (5x3+2)+[022] cut switch version to further reduce thumb and outer index travel and potential trackball?
